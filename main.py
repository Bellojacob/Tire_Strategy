"""The goal of this application is to calculate the best strategy for a motorsport tire choice. This program will assume that the driver needs
to change tire compounds at least once throughout the race. The tires used for this simulation will titled, soft, medium, and hard. We will assign best
possible lap time under minimum fuel load (top qualifying time), as the precendent for lap time using the soft tire. We will also assign a lap time for 
soft tire at maximum fuel load. We can then add offsets in lap time for the medium and hard tires. 

This program should take in soft tire lap time(minimum fuel load), soft tire lap time(max fuel load), laps of race.

This program should give best strategy"""
